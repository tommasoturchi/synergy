In 1960 the visionary Joseph Licklider wrote "Man-Computer Symbiosis", looking forward to a day when computation could "augment the human intellect" in a similar way that mechanical tools augmented humans' physical abilities. Today, this vision is becoming reality as AI systems work alongside people in complex tasks ranging from visual analytics to code generation. While we have experience with expert systems and AI performing specific subtasks, we are still learning how to design truly synergistic systems where humans and AI work flexibly together, leveraging their complementary abilities.

In this workshop we aim to bring together researchers working or intending to work in this new and rich area. Some will bring experience in designing intelligent systems; others may have worked on synergistic systems using non-AI technology; some may bring understandings of human-human collaboration; and others still simply interested and excited by the potential opportunities on radically new interactions.

The workshop will include consortium partners from the new 10 million Euro project [TANGO](https://tango-horizon.eu/) "It takes two to tango: a synergistic approach to human-machine decision making".

### Topics and Themes

This workshop focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of systems enabling meaningful human-AI collaboration. We invite submissions in the following key areas:

**Interactive Decision-Making Systems**: Mechanisms and interfaces for real-time human-AI collaboration
- Explicit protocols for dynamic task allocation and handoff
- Methods for mutual understanding of capabilities and limitations
- Techniques for combining human intuition with AI analysis
- Approaches for handling disagreement and uncertainty

**Adaptive Collaboration Frameworks**: Systems that dynamically adjust based on ongoing interaction
- Real-time assessment of human cognitive load
- Learning mechanisms from human intervention
- Dynamic adaptation of AI behavior
- Context-aware collaboration strategies

**Evaluation Methods**: Novel approaches to measuring human-AI collaboration effectiveness
- Metrics for assessing genuine partnership
- Methods for evaluating joint decision quality
- Techniques for measuring cognitive load and satisfaction
- Frameworks for comparing different collaboration models

**Implementation Architectures**: Practical solutions for building collaborative systems
- Software patterns for responsive interaction
- Methods for maintaining human agency
- Integration approaches for existing AI capabilities
- Real-world case studies and lessons learned

We particularly welcome submissions that:
1. Present concrete mechanisms for human-AI collaboration
2. Provide empirical evaluation of collaborative systems
3. Demonstrate novel interaction patterns
4. Address practical implementation challenges

All submissions *should* demonstrate:
- Integration of both AI capabilities and human interaction aspects
- Consideration of practical design and implementation implications
- Clear connection to human-AI collaboration, even in theoretical or policy-focused work

### Contributing Your Work

Submissions should be between 5 and 10 pages long, following the [CEUR-WS instructions](https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html) for single column papers. Longer submissions may be considered, provided they remain within reasonable limits. Please note that submissions do not need to be anonymized.

The deadline for submissions is *March 29, 2026* [AoE](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth). Submission website: TBD.

Please send any comments or questions to Tommaso Turchi, [tommaso.turchi@unipi.it](mailto:tommaso.turchi@unipi.it).
