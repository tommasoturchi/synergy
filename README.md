# SYNERGY
## Designing and Building Hybrid Human–AI Systems

### Outline

This page describes the [AVI 2024](https://avi2024.dibris.unige.it/home) Workshop on Hybrid Human-AI Systems.
- **Venue**: Arenzano, Genoa, Italy
- **Workshop Date**: _Afternoon_ of June 3 or 4, 2024

In 1960 the visionary Joseph Licklider wrote “Man-Computer Symbiosis”, looking forward to a day when computation could "augment the human intellect" in a similar way that mechanical tools augmented humans' physical abilities.  Sixty years on, this vision seems about to become reality.  AI systems are working alongside people in many areas including complex visual analytics, coding using tools such as co-pilot and music composition with generative AI.  We have long experience in expert systems elicitation techniques that attempt to capture and often substitute human expertise in AI systems and also in systems where AI performs some sub-task such as speech recognition.  However, we are still in the infancy of understanding how to design and build truly synergistic systems where humans and AI work flexibly alongside one another complimenting the different abilities of each.  Some human-in-the-loop systems, effectively mean the human is a cog in the machine, however true synergy means adapting AI algorithms to work more meaningfully with human intervention and adapting user interactions to make human intentions more available to the AI.

In this workshop we aim to bring together researchers working or intending to work in this new and rich area.  Some will bring experience in designing intelligent systems; others may have worked on synergistic systems using non-AI technology; some may bring understandings of human-human collaboration; and others still simply interested and excited by the potential opportunities on radically new interactions.

The workshop will include consortium partners from the new 10 million Euro project [TANGO](https://tango-horizon.eu/) "It takes two to tango: a synergistic approach to human-machine decision making".

### Topics and Themes

The topics include <u>but are not limited to</u>:

1. **Human-AI Collaboration Models**: Investigating new models for collaboration that leverage AI's computational power to enhance human decision-making and creativity, crucial for the development of next-generation visual interfaces.
2. **Augmenting Human Cognition with AI**: Focusing on how AI can be integrated into visual interfaces to augment human cognitive processes, a topic that resonates with AVI's interest in expanding the boundaries of user interaction.
3. **Design Principles for Synergistic Systems**: Discussing design strategies for systems where AI and humans collaborate, ensuring these systems are intuitive, efficient, and aligned with human-centric design principles.
4. **Ethics and Trust in Human-AI Interaction**: Addressing the ethical implications and trust dynamics in AI-integrated systems, a topic of growing importance as these systems become more pervasive.
5. **Philosophical and Theoretical Approaches**: Uncovering fundamental issues surrounding and underpinning human–AI collaborations.
6. **Adaptive Interfaces for Human-AI Synergy**: Exploring how visual interfaces can adapt to both AI capabilities and human needs, a key area for advancing HCI research.
7. **Software Architectures and Tools**: Frameworks, infrastructure and toolkits to enable the prototyping and development of systems for synergistic interaction.
8. **Case Studies of Human-AI Synergy**: Showcasing real-world applications where AI and humans work in tandem, offering insights into practical implementations and evaluations.
