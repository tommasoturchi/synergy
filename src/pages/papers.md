### List of Accepted Papers
1. Serena Versino, Tommaso Turchi, and Alessio Malizia. **Fostering Inexperienced User Participation in ML-based Systems Design: A Literature Review of Visual Language Tools**. This review explores how Visual Programming Languages (VPLs) can enhance accessibility and understanding of ML-based system design for non-technical users, despite limitations in customizability.
    
<!-- %The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in various sectors is based on machine learning (ML) systems, which, despite their transformative potential, can be complex and opaque for non-technical users. This review explores the role of Visual Programming Languages (VPLs) in lowering these barriers, enhancing the accessibility of ML-based system design for domain experts. We examine the application of ML processes through VPLs, seeking tools that open AI to a broader audience while identifying current challenges and future research directions.  Bridging the gap between experts and the broader society is necessary, especially in sectors where responsible and trustworthy AI systems play a pivotal role in decision-making. By democratizing AI, we aim to provide socio-technical conditions that enable users with diverse backgrounds to actively contribute to the design of ML-based systems, enhancing their understanding and trust. Therefore, this literature review addresses also how VPL-based tools incorporate features for interpretability and collaboration. Our findings reveal that tools either lack comprehensive customizability, demand computing proficiency, or lack interpretability features. These limitations can affect a synergistic communication between users and intelligent systems, uncovering a research gap in the development of VPLs suited for novices engaged in the design of ML-based systems. -->
2. Tommaso Turchi. **Human \& AI: Fool Us - Crafting Synergistic Interactions with Insights from Magic**. The paper argues that integrating stage magic techniques into AI design can enhance transparency and user engagement, fostering a more synergistic relationship between humans and AI.

<!-- %This position paper investigates how the art of magic, with its focus on audience perception and expectation, can inspire more effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) interactions, promoting a synergistic relationship between humans and AI. By adapting techniques from stage magic psychology, we explore ways to enhance transparency and engagement in AI systems, thereby improving user trust and engagement. Our approach focuses on developing adaptive interaction designs that encourage a genuine collaboration between humans and AI, leveraging their unique strengths for mutual augmentation. This contribution argues how magic can help AI transcend its conventional role, evolving into a co-decision ally that enriches human decision-making and creativity, paving the way for systems where humans and AI work together in truly flexible and complementary ways. -->
3. Eric Tron Gianet, Luigi Di Caro, and Amon Rapp. **Music Composition as a Lens for Understanding Human-AI Collaboration**. The authors propose using music composition as a context to explore human-AI collaboration, suggesting an ethnographic study to deeply understand this creative interaction.

<!-- %As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems gain human-like capabilities in creative tasks, they seem to blur the line between machines and users, prompting questions about how to design systems where AI and humans collaborate. Music composition with AI may offer a lens to explore the nuances of human-AI collaboration. We review recent literature on music generation with AI, highlighting key challenges like the need for user control and context awareness, and noting a potential shift in the user’s role towards curation or co-production when using AI tools. However, much of the existing research evaluates the impact of current AI tools rather than engaging in fieldwork to investigate music composition ”in practice” within specific socio-cultural contexts. We then propose an ethnographic study to understand music composition as a situated practice, considering composers’ personal motivations, artistic sensibilities, and the broader socio-cultural context. Preliminary findings highlight the importance of creative intentionality and meaning-making in driving compositional choices. Furthermore, music creation often involves collaboration between various human actors, raising questions about whether AI should facilitate this already present collaboration or disrupt existing dynamics. -->
4. Alan Dix, Ben Wilson, Matt Roach, Tommaso Turchi, and Alessio Malizia. **Epistemic Interaction – tuning interfaces to provide information for AI support**. This paper introduces the concept of epistemic interaction, which aims to refine human-AI interaction by leveraging subtle user behaviors to improve AI system learning and adaptability.

<!-- %As machine learning integrates deeper into human-computer interactions, the concept of epistemic interaction emerges, aiming to refine these interactions to enhance system adaptability. This approach encourages minor, intentional adjustments in user behaviour to enrich the data available for system learning. This paper introduces epistemic interaction within the context of human-system communication, illustrating how deliberate interaction design can improve system understanding and adaptation. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the potential of epistemic interaction to significantly advance human-computer interaction by leveraging intuitive human communication strategies to inform system design and functionality, offering a novel pathway for enriching user-system engagements. -->
5. Roberto Figliè, Tommaso Turchi, Giacomo Baldi, Daniele Mazzei. **Towards an LLM-based Intelligent Assistant for Industry 5.0**. The authors discuss the development of an LLM-based Intelligent Cognitive Assistant for Industry 5.0, aiming to integrate industrial data into a natural language interface to facilitate decision-making.

<!-- %Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has revolutionised industrial operations by enabling remote monitoring and control of machines, thereby enhancing productivity through data analysis. Dashboards have traditionally been the primary interface for accessing and interpreting data. However, they can lack adaptability and may overwhelm users with information. It is important to consider alternative methods of presenting data to avoid information overload. In response, Industry 5.0 (I5.0) has emerged, advocating for a human-centric approach. Advancements in technology, specifically auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs), have enabled the development of Intelligent Cognitive Assistants (ICAs) that enhance user interactions through natural language dialog. This paper presents the initial steps towards constructing an LLM-based ICA for I5.0 applications. Our system integrates industrial data from IoT-connected machines into a chatbot interface, with the aim of simplifying the decision-making process for managers and operators. Through expert evaluation, we are iteratively refining our prototype before conducting usability tests with end-users. This will lay the groundwork for future developments in human-centric industrial solutions. -->
6. Peter Daish, Nicholas Micallef, Nuria Lorenzo-Dus, Adeline Paiement, and Deepak Sahoo. **Towards Co-Designing a Continuous-Learning Human-AI Interface: A Case Study in Online Grooming Detection**. This paper presents a framework for incorporating diverse stakeholder perspectives into the design of Human-AI interfaces, with a focus on a continuous-learning system for online grooming detection.

<!-- %Interest is growing in using Human-Centered design to enhance compatibility of AI within human environments. These design techniques are valid for eliciting human-centered design requirements, however, they often paint the scenario that AI interaction design is a one-way process in which user behaviour is captured to improve interactions and user experiences. Such an approach does not consider real-world settings in which Human-AI environments involve multiple stakeholders, with contrasting needs, which could impact the interactivity, usability and usefulness of Human-AI environments. In this paper, we present a framework for incorporating multiple-stakeholders perspectives into the design of Human-AI environments, designed to establish a common dialogue between end-users' needs for Human-AI interaction and AI developers practical limitations. This is a work in progress project and in our future work we plan to follow this iterative prototyping approach to develop a real-world continuous-learning Human-AI detection system for online grooming. -->
7. Piero Marra, Lorenzo Pulito, Antonio Carnevale, Antonio Lombardi, Abeer Dyoub, and Francesca Lisi. **A Procedural Idea of Decision-making in the Context of Symbiotic AI**. The study explores a procedural approach to AI decision-making that aligns with European legal standards, aiming for a symbiotic relationship that ensures ethical and effective AI outputs.

<!-- %The European legal framework on Artificial Intelligence seems not to pay particular attention in regulating and shaping technologies where human and artificial intelligences can cooperate in a two-way relationship. This is a true technological challenge. The paper is the result of a foundational study aiming to conceptualise and design a holistic symbiotic approach to Artificial Intelligence in order to produce fair, legitimate, and effective outputs ensuring their ethical and legal acceptability. -->
8. Mario Alessandro Bochicchio, and Simona Corciulo. **Symbiosys and Synesthesia in Proactive Conversational Agents for Healthy Ageing**. The paper introduces a Conversational Companion for elderly people, developed under the Age-It Project, employing symbiotic AI to support healthy aging.

<!-- %Population ageing is a major, and unprecedented, 21st century phenomenon. In this context, the Age-It Project proposes a Conversational Companion for elderly and frail people, based on the concept of symbiotic AI and on the requirements defined within the Multicomponent Intervention for Active and Healthy Ageing of the Project. -->
9. Ben Wilson, Darren Scott, Matt Roach, Emily Nielsen, and Berndt Muller. **Designing for situated AI-human decision making: Lessons learned from a primary care deployment**. This case study evaluates the challenges and lessons from deploying AI systems in UK primary care, emphasizing the importance of participatory design and continuous improvement.

<!-- %We present a case study of AI deployment in a UK primary care (family doctor) setting. This demonstrates some of the challenges of real-world deployment of AI-human systems for decision-making. We use the seven domains of the NASSS (nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability) framework to structure the presentation of our evaluation. We highlight three key lessons that should inform not only future deployments and evaluations, but future design work itself. The lessons are to attend to wider impacts, incorporate quality improvement and quality assurance techniques and employ participatory design, iterative development and formative evaluation. -->

This research uses eye-tracking to predict pilot performance in simulated takeoffs, demonstrating the potential for AI to enhance safety and performance in aviation.

<!-- %Flight instruments provide pilots with many different indications, where a significant amount of information is processed via the human eyes. As such, there is an opportunity to capture knowledge from pilots’ eye movements in an effort to inform machine learning models in the prediction of pilot success and failure. In the event of inferring a potential failure, an intelligent flight deck can then warn and alert the crew to take early action in order to prevent further errors and evade disasters. To this end, this paper presents a preliminary case study in a simulated flight take-off environment to investigate the feasibility of utilizing pilots’ eye gaze when predicting pilot success and failure. The preliminary results indicate that accurate predictions of pilot performance can be achieved with at least 80\% accuracy after only 20 seconds of analyzing pilots’ gaze, highlighting the potential of realizing intelligent flight decks in the future. This finding suggests that it is likely feasible to support human-machine teaming in aviation, whereby the next generation of aircrafts can leverage artificial intelligence in the development of intelligent flight decks to optimize safety and pilot performance. -->
11. Miriana Calvano, Antonio Curci, Rosa Lanzilotti, and Antonio Piccinno. **The Human-Centered Approach to Design and Evaluate Symbiotic AI Systems**. The authors propose a framework for designing symbiotic AI systems that prioritize user needs and transparency to facilitate informed decisions and enhance human-AI interaction.

<!-- %Artificial Intelligence (AI) is spreading in many domains, revolutionizing the way individuals conceive their working and private life; it enhances many tasks by automating decision-making and augmenting human capabilities. It is necessary to design high-quality AI systems that focus on the users’ priorities and avoid potential unethical and unexpected behaviours. The widespread adoption of AI solutions faces challenges related to their transparency, since humans must be enabled to fully understand the outputs of such systems in order to make informed decisions. To address these concerns, a shift toward a human-centered approach is emerging when it comes to interact with AI systems. In this new scenario, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) plays a pivotal role and contaminates AI to reach the human-AI symbiosis. Designers and developers should gravitate towards Symbiotic AI (SAI), which has the goal to support humans without replacing them and establish a symbiotic relationship with users, adapting to their cognitive models. This contribution aims to present a proposal of a framework to design high-quality SAI systems and metrics that can be employed to appropriately evaluate them. Opportunities and challenges that characterize this new research context are also presented and discussed." -->

This paper outlines an exploratory study focused on developing AI-enhanced tools for multiplayer game development, emphasizing user-centered design and iterative testing.

<!-- %In response to the increasing requirements for advanced tools that facilitate game development, this paper presents the exploratory phase of a research project guided by User-Centered Design (UCD) principles. This phase is dedicated to the conceptualization and preliminary assessment of an AI-enhanced utility, termed MUN (Metaverse Unity Networking). Initiated through a detailed investigation of user needs and preferences, the study employs qualitative research methodologies, including eight in-depth interviews and a focus group discussion with three developers. The development of algorithms for this project leads to the establishment of a recommendation engine aimed at refining the selection process of programming methods and strategies for multiplayer game development. Furthermore, it incorporates mechanisms for the detection and correction of errors within the source code. Subsequent to a sequence of iterative tests (comprising three iterations with a collective participation of 40 users), the utility was subjected to a final usability evaluation involving 32 developers. This document focuses on the initial phase of the project, detailing the primary findings related to user needs and expectations as identified during this exploratory stage. -->
13. Paolo Grigis, and Antonella De Angeli. **Roleplay with Large Language Model-Based Characters: A Creative Writers Perspective**. The authors discuss a case study where creative writers engage in roleplay with LLM-based characters, aiming to explore and support creative writing through innovative human-computer interaction practices.

<!-- %Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) had a significant resonance in the artistic sector. As a result, numerous dialogue interfaces show potential applications for creative practices, of which creative writing is the focus of this paper. Although some studies have identified roleplaying with LLMs as a strategy to support artistic inspiration, there are still many open questions. For example, studies on how writers could employ LLMs based on roleplay with fictional characters require further investigation. To address this gap, we present a case study we are designing for the involvement of creative writers in roleplay interaction with LLMs. This study aims to provide training on how to use Faraday. dev, (a platform designed to create LLM-based characters). Subsequently, we will invite the writers to roleplay with their creations and complete a creative writing task. Collecting the prompt used to edit the characters, the chat logs between the writers and the characters, the final writing excerpts, and conducting follow-up interviews, we aim to gain insights on how LLM-based characters impact creative writing. Ultimately, this study seeks to inform the design of roleplay-based systems and enhance support for creative practice in the HCI domain. -->
